UNIX was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things.

All software sucks, be it open-source [or] proprietary. The only question is what can be done with particular instance of suckage, and that’s where having the source matters.

Unix is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity.

Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight.

Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.
        - Bertrand Meyer

Complexity kills. It sucks the life out of developers, it makes products difficult to plan, build and test, it introduces security challenges and it causes end-user and administrator frustration.

Mostly, when you see programmers, they aren’t doing anything. One of the attractive things about programmers is that you cannot tell whether or not they are working simply by looking at them. Very often they’re sitting there seemingly drinking coffee and gossiping, or just staring into space. What the programmer is trying to do is get a handle on all the individual and unrelated ideas that are scampering around in his head.

Every language has an optimization operator. In C++ that operator is ‘//’

Theory is when you know something, but it doesn’t work. Practice is when something works, but you don’t know why. Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don’t know why.

A computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match

The best code is no code at all.

Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.

The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and avoids clever tricks like the plague.

Parkinson’s Law Otherwise known as the law of bureaucracy, this law states that…
“Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.”

Code never lies, comments sometimes do.

… the cost of adding a feature isn’t just the time it takes to code it. The cost also includes the addition of an obstacle to future expansion. … The trick is to pick the features that don’t fight each other.

Comparing to another activity is useful if it helps you formulate questions, it’s dangerous when you use it to justify answers.

Software obeys the law of gaseous expansion - it continues to grow until memory is completely filled.

Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats much of the purpose of using one.
